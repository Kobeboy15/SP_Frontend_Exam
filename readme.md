# SP Front-End Developer Test

Using the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as a starting point, render
the list of items as a horizontally scrolling list.

## Requirements

1. If the list overflows its container, add two elements that, when clicked,
   scroll the content left or right:
   a. The two elements do not have to be the `<button>` HTML element. Use
   whichever elements you think are best.
   b. The two elements must be active and usable when the list content
   overflows its container.
   c. When the list container is wide enough to display all of its elements
   without the need for scrolling, the two elements MUST be disabled,
   hidden, or removed completely.
   d. The state of the two elements MUST respond dynamically to changes in
   the size of the list container. It is not sufficient to calculate
   their state only on page load.
   e. JavaScript to handle the scroll elements MUST be encapsulated in a
   function that accepts the list container element as its argument.
   f. It MUST be possible to have multiple list containers on the page and
   for each to be handled with a separate call to the function.

2. It MUST be possible for the user to scroll the list even if JavaScript is
   disabled in the browser.

3. The given files are only a starting point. Modify them as necessary.

4. Your code MUST work in the latest stable versions of Chrome and Firefox
   desktop web browsers.

5. Use only vanilla CSS and JavaScript. Please do not use any CSS
   preprocessors or JavaScript libraries.

## Review Criteria

Here are some of the things that we will be looking for:

1. Clean, well-structured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. A visually appealing layout that is functional and accessible.
3. Usability in browsers across a variety of device sizes such as desktop,
   tablet, and mobile.
4. Usability with pointing devices and touchscreens.
5. Progressive enhancement.
